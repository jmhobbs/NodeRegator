# What Is NodeRegator

NodeRegator is an utterly simple tool to track basic traffic information across multiple domains.  NodeRegator is not a replacement for GA, Piwik, Hummingbird or anything else you think it may be for.

# Why NodeRegator

I have a bunch of sites spread across multiple GA accounts, and I want to compare them. Nothing fancy, just really basic information. This is my quick fix for that.
